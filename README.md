# Raman Spectra Analysis Tool

This project provides a program capable of fully analyzing Raman and IR spectra from different types of spectrometers. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) and supports various baseline removal and peak finding strategies.

## Features

- **Peak Fitting**: The tool allows for fitting of peaks with full Voigt profiles, pseudo Voigt profiles, Fano, Fano Voigt, and Gaussian and Lorentzian models individually.
- **Post-Processing**: Provides post-processed data between all peaks in the spectrum.
- **Batch Processing**: Includes a batch processing routine for handling multiple datasets at once.
- **Spectrometer Support**: Currently supports Horiba and B&WTech spectrometers. Any data file in .txt format can be processed.

## Future Developments

The project is under active development. Future functionalities will include map processing and expansion to IR data, CL data, and others.

## Contributing

If you want support for a particular spectrometer model, please send a sample to the author so the parsing can be included in the software.
